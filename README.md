# Trees-and-Money
I created a dashboard to visualize data regarding NYC's boroughs top examine a possible relationship between tree growth and income brackets.  

## Objective
Understand the frequency of collisions at various US airports and their potential costs to repair machinery or assess wildlife loss. 

## Findings
1. The busiest airport carrying the most passengers in 2014 was Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackon airport while New York's LaGuardia faced the lowest passenger traffic.
2. Across these airports, more than 30,000 collisions took place between airplanes/airplane related equipment and wildlife.
3. Majority of collisions (95%) did not result in any financial damage to the carrier while 5% of collisions did. This 5% equated to nearly $100 million worth of damage in wildlife and/or aircraft eqiupment.
4. LaGuardia Airport had the most damage from its collisions where 99% of the damage came from 1 collision. This collision noted that the aircraft was destroyed.
5. Dallas, Denver, and LaGuardia led the country in first, second, and third most collisions respectively. However, Laguardia and Denver airports were top 2 in cost per collision while Dallas was just outside the top 10. 


## Additional Analysis
1. Creating a dashboard that specifically analyzes the impact on animals across the country could be a next step.
    - Of all the wildlife affected, birds such as geese, pigeons, eagles, hawks and others seem to most caught in the crossfire with aircrafts.
2. An airline airline breakdown would be very interesting to visualize and monitor. I'd be able to pick up on potential patterns like whether or not a specific airline was more careless or incurred more damages. 
    - The Big 4 airlines: United, Southwest, Jetblue, and Delta may be able to survive several multi-millionare dollar collisions both from a financial and publicity standpoint. Yet, how about smaller, lesser known carriers?
