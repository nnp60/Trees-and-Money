# Trees-and-Money
I created a dashboard to visualize data regarding NYC's boroughs too examine a possible relationship between tree growth and income brackets.  

## Objective
Understand whether tree characteristics have any type of correlation with the income of residents in NYC's 5 boroughs. 

## Findings
1. Manhattan is the borough with the highest mean income of $150k and highest median income of $100k. All other boroughs are comfortably less than $100k by both average income metrics.
2. Queens has almost 1/3 of the city's tree population followed by Brooklyn. Manhattan has the least number of trees.
3. Queens also has the largest average trunk diameter size of over 18 inches while Manhattan has the smallest at less than 11 inches.
4. In all boroughs except, Brooklyn, there were more trees deemed within "good" and "fair" health in richest zipcodes in that borough compared to the poorest zipcode in that borough.

## Additional Analysis
1. Creating a dashboard that specifically analyzes the impact on animals across the country could be a next step.
    - Of all the wildlife affected, birds such as geese, pigeons, eagles, hawks and others seem to most caught in the crossfire with aircrafts.
2. An airline airline breakdown would be very interesting to visualize and monitor. I'd be able to pick up on potential patterns like whether or not a specific airline was more careless or incurred more damages. 
    - The Big 4 airlines: United, Southwest, Jetblue, and Delta may be able to survive several multi-millionare dollar collisions both from a financial and publicity standpoint. Yet, how about smaller, lesser known carriers?
