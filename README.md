# Trees-and-Money
I created a dashboard to visualize data regarding NYC's boroughs too examine a possible relationship between tree growth and income brackets.  

## Objective
Understand whether tree characteristics have any type of correlation with the income of residents in NYC's 5 boroughs. 

## Findings
1. Manhattan is the borough with the highest mean income of $150k and highest median income of $100k. All other boroughs are comfortably less than $100k by both average income metrics.
2. Queens has almost 1/3 of the city's tree population followed by Brooklyn. Manhattan has the least number of trees.
3. Queens also has the largest average trunk diameter size of over 18 inches while Manhattan has the smallest at less than 11 inches.
4. In all boroughs except, Brooklyn, there were more trees deemed within "good" and "fair" health in richest zipcodes in that borough compared to the poorest zipcode in that borough.

## Additional Analysis
1. Showcasing the different types of prominent trees within each borough may give us good possible indicators of tree health and tree size.
   - This type of analysis can also help us dig deeper into knowing the underlying terrain of each boroughs. Manhattan is very business (many skyscrapers) oriented while Queens is more residential.
2. Finding additional data that relates to air quality through AQI (air quality index) and oxygen metrics can help us see the impact of health in certain zipcodes based on tree type, health and size.
